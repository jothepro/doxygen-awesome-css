**Doxygen Awesome** is a custom **CSS theme for Doxygen HTML-documentation** with lots of customization parameters.

## Motivation

I really like how the Doxygen HTML-documentation is structured! But IMHO it looks a bit outdated.

This theme is an attempt to update the visuals of Doxygen without changing its overall layout too much.

## Features

- ðŸŒˆ Clean, modern design
- ðŸš€ Heavily customizable by adjusting CSS-variables
- ðŸ§© No changes to the HTML structure of Doxygen required
- ðŸ“± Improved mobile usability
- ðŸŒ˜ Dark mode support!
- ðŸ¥‡ Works best with **doxygen 1.9.1** - **1.9.4**

## Installation

To use the theme in your documentation, copy the required CSS and JS files from this repository into your project or add the repository as submodule and check out the latest release:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css.git
cd doxygen-awesome-css
git checkout v2.1.0
```

You can even install the theme system-wide by running `make install`. The files will be installed to `/usr/local/share/` by default, but you can customize the install location with `make PREFIX=/my/custom/path install`.

All theme files are located in the root of this repository and start with the prefix `doxygen-awesome-`. You may not need all of them. Follow the install instructions to figure out what files are required for your setup.

### Choosing a layout

There is two layout options. Choose one of them and configure Doxygen accordingly:

<div class="darkmode_inverted_image">

</div>



#### Base Theme (1)

Comes with the typical Doxygen titlebar. Optionally the treeview in the sidebar can be enabled. 

Required files: `doxygen-awesome.css`

Required `Doxyfile` configuration:
```
GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES # optional. Also works without treeview
DISABLE_INDEX = NO
FULL_SIDEBAR = NO
HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome.css
```

#### Sidebar-Only Theme (2)

Hides the top titlebar to give more space to the content. The treeview must be enabled in order for this theme to work.

Required files: `doxygen-awesome.css`, `doxygen-awesome-sidebar-only.css`

Required `Doxyfile` configuration:
```
GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES # required!
DISABLE_INDEX          = NO
FULL_SIDEBAR           = NO
HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome.css \
                         doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome-sidebar-only.css
```


**Caution**: This theme is not compatible with the `FULL_SIDEBAR = YES` option provided by Doxygen!
