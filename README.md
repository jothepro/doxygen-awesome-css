**Doxygen Awesome** is a custom CSS theme for Doxygen HTML documentation with lots of customization parameters.

## Motivation

I really like how the Doxygen HTML documentation is structured! But IMHO it looks a bit outdated.

This theme is an attempt to update the visuals of Doxygen without changing its overall layout too much.

## Features

- ðŸŒˆ Clean, modern design
- ðŸš€ Heavily customizable by adjusting CSS variables
- ðŸ§© No changes to the HTML structure of Doxygen are required
- ðŸ“± Improved mobile usability
- ðŸŒ˜ Dark mode support!
- ðŸ¥‡ Works best with **doxygen 1.9.1** - **1.9.4** and **1.9.6** - **1.12.0**

## Installation

To use the theme when generating your documentation, bring the required CSS and JS files from this repository into your project.

This can be done in several ways:

- manually copying the files
- adding the project as a Git submodule
- downloading the project with CMake FetchContent
- adding the project as a npm/xpm dependency
- installing the theme system-wide

All theme files are located in the root of this repository and start with the prefix `doxygen-awesome-`. You may not need all of them. Follow the install instructions to figure out what files are required for your setup.

### Git submodule
For projects that use git, add the repository as a submodule and check out the desired release:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css.git
cd doxygen-awesome-css
git checkout v2.3.4
```

### CMake with FetchContent

For project that build with CMake, the `FetchContent` module can be used to download the repository at configure-time.

Add the following snippet to your `CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    doxygen-awesome-css
    URL https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(doxygen-awesome-css)

# Save the location the files were cloned into
# This allows us to get the path to doxygen-awesome.css
FetchContent_GetProperties(doxygen-awesome-css SOURCE_DIR AWESOME_CSS_DIR)

# Generate the Doxyfile
set(DOXYFILE_IN ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/doc/Doxyfile.in)
set(DOXYFILE_OUT ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/Doxyfile)
configure_file(${DOXYFILE_IN} ${DOXYFILE_OUT} @ONLY)
```

This downloads the latest main (but any other revision could be used) and unpacks in the build folder. The `Doxyfile.in` can reference this location in the `HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET` field

```text
HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = @AWESOME_CSS_DIR@/doxygen-awesome.css
```

When the configure stage of CMake is run, the `Doxyfile.in` is rendered to Doxyfile and Doxygen can be run as usual.

### npm/xpm dependency

In the npm ecosystem, this project can be added as a development dependency
to your project:

```sh
cd your-project
npm install https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css#v2.3.4 --save-dev

ls -l node_module/@jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css
```

Similarly, in the [xPack](https://xpack.github.io) ecosystem, this project can be added
as a development dependency to an [`xpm`](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/)
managed project.

### System-wide

You can even install the theme system-wide by running `make install`.
The files will be installed to `/usr/local/share/` by default,
but you can customize the install location with `make PREFIX=/my/custom/path install`.

### Choosing a layout

There are two layout options. Choose one of them and configure Doxygen accordingly:

<div class="tabbed">

- <b class="tab-title">Base Theme</b><div class="darkmode_inverted_image">
    ![](img/theme-variants-base.drawio.svg)
    </div>
    Comes with the typical Doxygen titlebar. Optionally the treeview in the sidebar can be enabled.

    Required files: `doxygen-awesome.css`

    Required `Doxyfile` configuration:
    ```
    GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES # optional. Also works without treeview
    DISABLE_INDEX = NO
    FULL_SIDEBAR = NO
    HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome.css
    HTML_COLORSTYLE        = LIGHT # required with Doxygen >= 1.9.5
    ```

- <b class="tab-title">Sidebar-Only Theme</b><div class="darkmode_inverted_image">
    ![](img/theme-variants-sidebar-only.drawio.svg)
    </div>
    Hides the top titlebar to give more space to the content. The treeview must be enabled in order for this theme to work.

    Required files: `doxygen-awesome.css`, `doxygen-awesome-sidebar-only.css`

    Required `Doxyfile` configuration:
    ```

    GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES # required!
    DISABLE_INDEX          = NO
    FULL_SIDEBAR           = NO
    HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome.css \
                            doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome-sidebar-only.css
    HTML_COLORSTYLE        = LIGHT # required with Doxygen >= 1.9.5
    ```

</div>

<br>

@warning
- This theme is not compatible with the `FULL_SIDEBAR = YES` option provided by Doxygen!
- `HTML_COLORSTYLE` must be set to `LIGHT` since Doxygen 1.9.5!
