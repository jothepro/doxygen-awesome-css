**Doxygen Awesome** is a custom **CSS theme for Doxygen HTML-documentation** with lots of customization parameters.

## Motivation

I really like how the Doxygen HTML-documentation is structured! But IMHO it looks a bit outdated.

This theme is an attempt to update the visuals of Doxygen without changing its overall layout too much.

## Features

- ðŸŒˆ Clean, modern design
- ðŸš€ Heavily customizable by adjusting CSS-variables
- ðŸ§© No changes to the HTML structure of Doxygen required
- ðŸ“± Improved mobile usability
- ðŸŒ˜ Dark mode support!
- ðŸ¥‡ Works best with **doxygen 1.9.1** - **1.9.3**

## Examples

- Sidebar-Only theme: [Documentation of this repository](https://jothepro.github.io/doxygen-awesome-css/)
- Base theme: [libsl3](https://a4z.github.io/libsl3/)
 
## Installation

For the Base theme you can copy the file `doxygen-awesome.css` from this repository into your project. If you would like to use the Sidebar-Only theme, you must copy both `doxygen-awesome.css` _and_ `doxygen-awesome-sidebar-only.css` into your project.

Alternatively, add this repository as submodule and check out the latest release:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css.git
cd doxygen-awesome-css
git checkout v2.0.3
```

Choose one of the theme variants and configure Doxygen accordingly:

1. **Base theme**:
```
# Doxyfile
GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES # optional. Also works without treeview
HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome.css
```

2. **Sidebar-only theme**:
```
# Doxyfile
GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES # required!
HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome.css \              # Both of these are required!
                         doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome-sidebar-only.css   # Both of these are required!
```
